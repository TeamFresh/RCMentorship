# Week 2 Progress
Continued following instructions for blood vessel segmentation in 3d Slicer and vmtk. Current stuck at the seed-picking stage for colliding fronts segmentation in vmtk.

## What I have done
* Followed the provided instructions until step 5 (from Kurt's reply to the question from AD and I about 3D slicer). Help will be needed to continue
* Read two papers on tube detection: Frangi 1998 and Merveille 2014

## Who I worked with
No one for now

## Plan for next week
I just realized that what AD and I were supposed to do were to implement
existing algorithms instead of coming up with new algorithms for tube
detection. That makes much more sense now. I'll start looking into the
related libraries for implementing these algorithms, while I finish
rest of the papers and decide on one that would be suitable and feasible
to implement with AD.

## Plan for rest of quarter
Select an algorithm for tube detection. Become familiar with vmtk and other 
required libraries. Plan out the implementation steps for said algorithm
(including the testing and validation steps) and create a detailed and
sensible deadline for the implementation. At the end of the quarter I should
have written a simple python/c++ program using vmtk that is able to load
the image data and I should be ready to start implementing the filter.
